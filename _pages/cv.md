I graduated from Lobachevsky State University, Russia, in 2012 with a degree in theoretical physics, specialising in nonlinear dynamics and computational neuroscience. I later obtained my PhD in molecular neurobiology at the University of Osnabrück, Germany, in 2016, under the supervision of [Prof. Roland Brandt](https://www.neurobiologie.uni-osnabrueck.de/) and [Prof. Wolfgang Junge](https://www.home.uni-osnabrueck.de/wjunge/). My research focused on the regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton by the microtubule-associated protein Tau and its role in Alzheimer’s disease.

From 2016 to 2017, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the group of [Prof. Helmut Grubmüller](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/grubmueller) at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen, Germany. In 2017, I was awarded an individual research grant by the German Research Foundation and promoted to a project leader in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Biophysics. Between 2017 and 2024, my research investigated the nanoscale mechanics of microtubule self-assembly using large-scale computer simulations, as well as developing automated structure refinement methods for cryo-electron microscopy. In 2023, I was elected as an associate member of the International Max Planck Research School for Physics of Biological and Complex Systems ([IMPRS-PBCS](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/sh/58718.html)) and appointed as a thesis supervisor in the Research Training Group “Cytoskeleton elements of active matter – from molecular interactions to cellular biophysics” ([CYTAC](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/rtg2756)) at the University of Göttingen.

In 2024, I joined the [Division of Computational Biology](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/life-sciences/computational-biology) in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee to establish my own research group aiming to uncover the biomechanics of chromosome segregation during mitosis driven by microtubule-based forces.
